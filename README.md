# Welcome
## This project is meant to serve as a boilerplate code for creating finite state machines

### Using the library Futura (https://www.npmjs.com/package/futura), the project provides with a jumping off point for developing stable applications.
### This code does not exemplify all the features of the library, as that would defeat the purpose of a simple boilerplate code. 
### Styles are all located in index.html, and I personally prefer to use inline styles for compartmentalization and ease of understanding. This is also better for responsiveness.
